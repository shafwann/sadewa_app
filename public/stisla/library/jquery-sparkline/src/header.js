* Usage:
*  $(selector).sparkline(values, options)
*
* If values is undefined or set to 'html' then the data values are read from the specified tag:
*   <p>Sparkline: <span class="sparkline">1,4,6,6,8,5,3,5</span></p>
*   $('.sparkline').sparkline();
* There must be no spaces in the enclosed data set
*
* Otherwise values must be an array of numbers or null values
*    <p>Sparkline: <span id="sparkline1">This text replaced if the browser is compatible</span></p>
*    $('#sparkline1').sparkline([1,4,6,6,8,5,3,5])
*    $('#sparkline2').sparkline([1,4,6,null,null,5,3,5])
*
* Values can also be specified in an HTML comment, or as a values attribute:
*    <p>Sparkline: <span class="sparkline"><!--1,4,6,6,8,5,3,5 --></span></p>
*    <p>Sparkline: <span class="sparkline" values="1,4,6,6,8,5,3,5"></span></p>
*    $('.sparkline').sparkline();
*
* For line charts, x values can also be specified:
*   <p>Sparkline: <span class="sparkline">1:1,2.7:4,3.4:6,5:6,6:8,8.7:5,9:3,10:5</span></p>
*    $('#sparkline1').sparkline([ [1,1], [2.7,4], [3.4,6], [5,6], [6,8], [8.7,5], [9,3], [10,5] ])
*
* By default, options should be passed in as the second argument to the sparkline function:
*   $('.sparkline').sparkline([1,2,3,4], {type: 'bar'})
*
* Options can also be set by passing them on the tag itself.  This feature is disabled by default though
* as there's a slight performance overhead:
*   $('.sparkline').sparkline([1,2,3,4], {enableTagOptions: true})
*   <p>Sparkline: <span class="sparkline" sparkType="bar" sparkBarColor="red">loading</span></p>
* Prefix all options supplied as tag attribute with "spark" (configurable by setting tagOptionsPrefix)
*
* Supported options:
*   lineColor - Color of the line used for the chart
*   fillColor - Color used to fill in the chart - Set to '' or false for a transparent chart
*   width - Width of the chart - Defaults to 3 times the number of values in pixels
*   height - Height of the chart - Defaults to the height of the containing element
*   chartRangeMin - Specify the minimum value to use for the Y range of the chart - Defaults to the minimum value supplied
*   chartRangeMax - Specify the maximum value to use for the Y range of the chart - Defaults to the maximum value supplied
*   chartRangeClip - Clip out of range values to the max/min specified by chartRangeMin and chartRangeMax
*   chartRangeMinX - Specify the minimum value to use for the X range of the chart - Defaults to the minimum value supplied
*   chartRangeMaxX - Specify the maximum value to use for the
